# Mini-Hackathon with Free Code Camp and Girl Develop It

A prototype for an app that watches the buzz around the SpaceX program.

This was my first ever hackathon-like experience. Although not a full hackathon, it was a tremendous learning experience. One big takeaway was that working on a team requires much organization, planning, and a clear goal. Another one was no matter your skill level, you can contribute much to a project if you have a solid grasp of the basics and you're willing to cooperate and learn.
